6-2 a) Run a depth first search algorithm on the libraries anf their dependencies and append each library to a list when the depth first search algorithm has completed it's run through a library. 
	Then, once the depth first search has completed, reverse the lists order and that will be a valid order to install.

6-2 b) Again use similar approach as before running a depth first search.

psuedocode:

installed_dict={...some pre-installed libraries in here ...}
for library in P:
	if installed_dict.get(library, False):
		continue
	else:
		DFS(library, installed_dict)
		

def DFS(library, dictionary):

	for dep in library.dependencies:
		if dictionary.get(dep,False):
			continue
		else:
			DFS(dep, dicitonary)
	install(library)
	dictionary[library]=True
